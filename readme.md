Small boilerplate repo to get kickstarted with React and TypeScript.
Contains only the bare minimum: 
- Webpack
- AVA (unit tests)
- ts-loader
- babel (ts > es6 > babel > es5)
- SASS-loader
- typescript 1.9 > 

### A note on TypeScript 1.6
There is a bug in current 1.9 @next branch.  https://github.com/TypeStrong/ts-loader/issues/227
Included a typescript.js (replace with your node_moules>typescript.js file). 
Or if the problem is fixed in your TS version... good for you :) )

## Dev Install
Project is using Typescript 1.9 > 
This means that the project uses its own TypeScript compiler (node tsc). Make sure your IDE is up for the task with 
TS 1.9 >.

#### Install deps.
``
npm install
``
