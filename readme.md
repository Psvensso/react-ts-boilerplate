Small boilerplate repo to get kickstarted with React and TypeScript.
Just contains bare minimums: 

- Webpack
- AVA (unit tests)
- ts-loader
- babel (ts > es6 > babel > es5)
- SASS-loader
- typescript 1.9 > 

## Dev Install
Project is using Typescript 1.9 > 
This means that the project uses its own TypeScript compiler (node tsc). Make sure your IDE is up for the task with 
TS 1.9 >.

#### Install deps.
``
npm install
``
